**rigfetch** is a little script like [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch)
for raspian based distros like:

- [MainsailOS](https://github.com/raymondh2/MainsailOS)
- [FluiddPI](https://github.com/cadriel/FluiddPI)
- [OctoPI](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi)

## What it should do ( mostly it does :) )

### TODO:

- Documentation
- Installer Script
- Credits
- and much more


Till it has an Installer script simply do:

`git clone https://github.com/KwadFan/rigged.git`

for simplicity make an link to script with:

`ln -s path/to/rigfetch.sh /usr/bin/rigfetch`

>Set path/to/rigfetch.sh according to your path, usually /home/pi/rigged/rigfetch.sh

*This project is heavily under cunstruction, so, please be patient*
