# Contributing to rigged

rigged, or rigfetch till now, are tools to add some "Informative Screens" to
Distributions like MainsailOS or FluiddPI. They heavily needs Klipper and Moonraker
As such, contributing guidelines are near those of Klipper or Moonraker:

- All source files should begin with a copyright notice in the following
  format:
  ```
  # Module name and brief description of module
  #
  # Copyright (C) 2020 YOUR NAME <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
  #
  # This file may be distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license
  ```
- No line in the source code or documentation should exceed 80 characters.
  Be sure there is no trailing whitespace.
- Each Commit message should be in the following format:
  ```
  module name: brief description of commit

  More detailed explanation if necessary.

  Signed-off-by:  Your Name <your email address>
  ```
- By signing off on commits, you acknowledge that you agree to the
  [developer certificate of origin](developer-certificate-of-origin).
  As with rigged, this must contain your real name and a current
  email address.
